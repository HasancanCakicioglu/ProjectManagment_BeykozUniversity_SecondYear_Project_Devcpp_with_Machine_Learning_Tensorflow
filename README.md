# Project Management - Second Year Project


This repository contains the source code for the **Project Management** project developed as part of the second year project at Beykoz University. The project is implemented using C++ and TensorFlow library for creating a linear regression model.

## Project Description

The **Project Management** application is designed to assist users in planning and managing their projects. It utilizes artificial intelligence techniques, specifically a linear regression model, to generate predictions for project duration and cost based on user input. The user can provide project specifications and requirements, and the AI model predicts the estimated duration and cost.

The project offers the following features:

- User-friendly interface: The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can interact with the system.
- Project planning: Users can input project details, such as tasks, resources, and dependencies, to create a project plan.
- AI predictions: The linear regression model built with TensorFlow predicts the duration and cost of the project based on the provided inputs.
- Project tracking: Users can track the progress of their projects, monitor changes, and update project information.
- Visualization: The application displays the project details and progress in the command-line interface, allowing users to visualize their projects.

## Prerequisites

Before running the **Project Management** application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- TensorFlow library (version X.X.X or higher)
- Any additional libraries or dependencies required by your specific environment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/HasancanCakicioglu/ProjectManagment_BeykozUniversity_SecondYear_Project_Devcpp_with_Machine_Learning_Tensorflow.git
```
